# Creating a File Upload Component with Vue.js

Creating file-upload components can be quite hard.

Not only because you need to deal with files in JavaScript. Also, because you need an API to test against before you can actually start coding.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to do both.

First, we will create a simple express server with just one route to accept file uploads.
This server will be written entirely in TypeScript.

Afterward, we will create a vue application from scratch and build a beautiful file-upload component using nothing but vue itself with TypeScript.

Here is what the final result will look like:
